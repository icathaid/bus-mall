As a bus rider, I need something to occupy my time while I sit in traffic.
As a customer, I need a retailer that sells products I want to buy.
As the seller of a unique product, I need a way to reach potential customers that aren't actively trying to find my product.
As the publisher of Bus Mall, I need to analyze which products are more likely to sell so that I can more efficiently use the resources available to me.
As a project manager, I need an interface that will enable customers to give publishers input and create a product more tailored to our consumers, or a better pathway to those products.
As a bus driver, I need something to distract my passengers so they don't notice how many cyclists I run off the road.
