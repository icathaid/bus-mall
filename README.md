# bus-mall

set up variables and instances in JS, got app.js to kick out good data to index.html (page loads blank; entering showProd(i) in the console will reload the page, displaying the image indexed at allProducts[i].filepath)
I'm pushing commits before I break everything.

added randomizer and event listener.  by default, the container is invisible and apparently tiny, so you have to either find it(?) or manually invoke the function randomProd() from the console.  It will subsequently run when clicked.  will have to finish up later, pushing commits.

duh.  never called the function in the script.

added clickcounter, pushing commits before going further.

added conditional function to limit to 25 clicks, now I need to make this into three images :/  pushing commits before going back to html side

added a second picture and a conditional to make sure they aren't the same picture.  worked on the first try.  growing suspicious.

added third pic, pushing commits and then i have a bus to catch.
