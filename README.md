This is a simple app to help the Bus-Mall! Corporation test the viability of products it intends to include in its upcoming Spring 2018 Bus-Mall! Catalog.  It will show the user 3 different products with a short description of each, and ask them to choose which one they would be most likely to buy.  It then shows them three new different products, and continues for 25 cycles, after which it shows them the results of their voting.  Results are stored in local memory and updated after each round of voting to establish a larger sample size.
